04 : add two adc, sequence output


pay  attention:


type 1 (adc not circle, dma not circle)
     |
adc init				
     |
start dma (must use in sequencer mode)<-|
     |
adc start				|
     |
waitting until it is done		|
     |
get the adc data                 	^
     |
wait    (higher interrupt periority     |
     |
      - - - - - - > - - - - - - - - - - >


type 2 (adc circle, dma circle)
     |
adc init				
     |
start dma                           
     |
adc start				
     |
waitting until it is done   < - -<-  -	-	
     |
get the adc data                	^
